I'm a second year graduate student at Stanford University. 

My research interests are in using Machine Learning to understand and predict the structure and behavior of biochemical systems. The goal of my thesis project in the [Das Lab](https://daslab.stanford.edu) is to develop a generative model for RNA aptamer design. 

Along those lines, I am interested in implementing the methods used by biological systems to perform complex computations for improving aritificial intelligence.
